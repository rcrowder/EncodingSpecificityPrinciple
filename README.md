EncodingSpecificityPrinciple
============================

The purpose of this repository is to investigate the encoding of auditory signals (cochlear origin) and it's passage into the primary auditory cortex.

An intention is to use the [Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing](http://numenta.org/ "Numenta | NuPIC") library for high level abstraction and inference (only PreFrontalCortex and T2/T3?). Working down via the Thalamas (MGN, and Brodmann area 41 (A1) links), inferior colliculus (Midbrain), the lateral lemniscus (Pons), Superior olivary nuclei, to the Cochlear nuclei.
